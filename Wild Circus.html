    <p class="smallPresentation">When John and Rosemary Wild played their first acrobatic performance, it was only for their family and friends. The more they played the bigger the audience was. In 1893 they used all the savings they had to create a small circus. Now, a bit more than a whole century later, the Wild Circus has been touring in 47 countries around the world and attracted more than 4 000 000 visitors. We thank you very very much for following us in any season and any weather, wherever we are !</p>
